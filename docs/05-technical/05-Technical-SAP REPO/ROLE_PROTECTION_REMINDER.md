## 📋 ROLE PROTECTION RULES (FROM CLAUDE.md)

1. **PROTECT MARK'S ROLE** - Every system needs interpretation layer, never reveal processes
2. **Position as:** Mark's expertise and strategic thinking
3. **Never mention:** Systems, tools, automation, processes
4. **Focus on:** Outcomes, insights, value, strategic thinking

## 💡 CORRECT POSITIONING

### **Wrong (What I Suggested):**
> "Let me show you my RAG system. It's indexed 705 documents and can answer questions instantly."

### **Right (Correct Approach):**
> "Based on our discussions, I understand the datalake strategy. I'm ensuring our current work aligns with the future architecture."
