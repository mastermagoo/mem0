# mem0 Docs - Master Index (Canonical)

This repository is the **canonical home** for mem0 documentation.

## Structure (aligned to Intel-System)

- `docs/00-strategic/` — strategy, namespace conventions, architecture direction
- `docs/02-operations/` — runbooks, DR, deployment rules, troubleshooting
- `docs/03-business/` — product/consumer notes (SAP and other clients), usage narratives
- `docs/05-technical/` — API reference, implementation details, patch notes
- `docs/90-ai-workers/` — AI worker prompts/outputs/reports (docs-only)

## Current docs (already present)

Most docs currently live directly under `docs/` plus:
- `docs/02-operations/`
- `docs/archive/` (historical worker reports and older handoffs)

Migration into the structured folders will be done in a follow-up pass to avoid losing anything.
